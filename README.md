# freebsd-ssd1306-oled-driver
Driver to show FreeBSD system stats on a ssd1306 128x32 pixel oled display

The main goal in developing this driver was to run OPNSense on a 52Pi CM4 router board and display some system statistics.
The main parts of the code were written with ChatGPT (support was provided by the OpenAI GPT-3 API) and using available code from:

https://github.com/610t/FreeBSD_I2C
https://github.com/NateLol/luci-app-oled

Therefore, feel free to optimize the code.
